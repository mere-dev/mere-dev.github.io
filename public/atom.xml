        <content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;our-standards&quot;&gt;Our Standards&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our standards must be grounded in the pursuit of Truth. We recognize that Truth is not always obvious at first, and must often be discovered through rigorious debate. Therefore we expect a common understanding and tolerance for freedom on speech, including seemingly offensive speech. This does not mean unlimited restrictions however, and the following are not considered protected speech&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Any speech meant to incite violence&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Any form of blasphemy&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Any oppression of Religion&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Examples of unacceptable behavior include:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Any activity meant to diminish human flourishing&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Any activity meant to prevent the free expression of religion&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Any activity meant to destroy our mission and community&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Any activity which may cause undue harm to children, or any other person not capable of autonomy&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;enforcement-responsibilities&quot;&gt;Enforcement Responsibilities&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of
acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and corrective action in
response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening or harmful.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation
decisions when appropriate.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;enforcement&quot;&gt;Enforcement&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at
&lt;a href=&quot;mailto:contact@mere.dev&quot;&gt;contact@mere.dev&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone accused has the right to face their accusor.
Anyone has the right to resolve their dispute through arbitration with mutually elected mediators.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;enforcement-guidelines&quot;&gt;Enforcement Guidelines&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Community leaders may consult and quote The Bible for guidelines in determining
the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Community leaders may choose to adopt mutual arbitration, providing that all 
arbtitrators respect the use of the Bible and God&#x27;s law&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

        <content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;preamble&quot;&gt;Preamble&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the grace of God, Amen. His kingdom come, His will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We mere software engineers, automation architects and digital developers, find ourselves heirs to many great blessings of liberty and prosperity from those faithful generations before us, yet we seek to ensure the blessings of our Maker for our posterity, as loyal subjects of our Lord and King Jesus Christ.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;we have come into such a time that it seems necessary to provide hedges and boundaries, that the work of our hands may not be used blaspheme, and that all men shall recognize and proclaim the Lordship of Jesus Christ over all of life. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As has been the example and tradition of those many generations before us; in the examples of&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Magna Carta 1215.
Columbus Letter Announcing His Discovery 1493.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Mayflower Compact 1620.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pennsylvania Charter of Privileges 1701.
#Give Me Liberty Or Give Me Death Patrick Henry, 1775.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Declaration of Independence 1776.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Constitution of the United States ratified 1788.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;we establish this written covenant for all jurisdictions and all times, and by way example implementation, also memorialize an accompanying license to use, as is our current custom for intellectual properties.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-mere-developer-pledge&quot;&gt;The Mere Developer Pledge&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pledge our allegiance to Jesus Christ. Amen.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We recognize that there can be no good without Christ, and therefore can be no good developer without Christ.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We recognize that The Bible was not only inspired by God, but also the first mass produce book, and the source of common knowledge, common sense, common values, and ultimately shaped the language and definition of words for most of the western world.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We recognize that Religion as defined by The Bible is the practice and devotion to the one true God&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We recognize that False Religion is defined as the practice and devotion to gods other than the God of  The Bible&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pledge to do our work faithfully, as unto the Lord and for his Glory.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pledge to live according to God&#x27;s law, and to treat every man as God&#x27;s child.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pledge that the work of our hands and minds shall not be used to blaspheme the name of Jesus.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pledge that the work of our hands and minds shall not be used to stumble or inhibit the persuit of Jesus, or the establishment of his kingdom on earth.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We embrace the burden to establish where possible, means to train and nurture future developers in the admonishion of the Lord&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We embrace the burden to establish fortifications and bulwarks against and person, state or institution who would prevent free expression of Religion. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;freedom-of-religion-license&quot;&gt;FREEDOM OF RELIGION LICENSE&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DEFINITIONS&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This License” refers to the Freedom of Religion License.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Copyright” also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The Program” refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License. Each licensee is addressed as “you”. “Licensees” and “recipients” may be individuals or organizations.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To “modify” a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy. The resulting work is called a “modified version” of the earlier work or a work “based on” the earlier work.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A “covered work” means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the Program.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To “propagate” a work means to do anything with it that, without permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification), making available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To “convey” a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An interactive user interface displays “Appropriate Legal Notices” to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License. If the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The Bible&amp;quot; is recognized to be the first mass printed volume of the western world, and the locus of all definitions.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Religion&amp;quot; is the devotion to the one true God, as defined by the Bible.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;False Religion&amp;quot; is the devotion to any other god not the god of The Bible&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;to &amp;quot;Blaspheme&amp;quot; is curse God, as defined by The Bible&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Basic Permissions&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1.1 Human Flourishment&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This program shall be used for the purposes of human flourishment. And to encourage the mandate given to all mankind (Gen 1:26-28)&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Forbidden Permissions&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2.1 Blasphemy&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Program shall not be used to enact Blasphemy&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2.2 Oppression of Religion&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The use of The Program, whether source code or object code, shall not be used in any way to oppress or mitigate the free exercise of Religion. The expression of False Religion is not protected under This License&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2.2 Oppression of Freedoms&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The program shall not be used in any to oppress or mitigate the God given rights of any man, nor prevent any man from fulfilling their God given responsibilities.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2.3 Protection for Posterity&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Program may be kept private and sold for profit for a maximum of one human generation, after which it shall be made public for the benefit and flourishing of future generations. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2.4 Enforcement of Disputes&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This license shall be applicable &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Protecting Users&#x27; Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.
No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work&#x27;s users, your or third parties&#x27; legal rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;4&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Conveying Verbatim Copies.
You may convey verbatim copies of the Program&#x27;s source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating that this License and any non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Conveying Modified Source Versions.
You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it, and giving a relevant date.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released under this License and any conditions added under section 7. This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to “keep intact all notices”.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7 additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts, regardless of how they are packaged. This License gives no permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work need not make them do so.
A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an “aggregate” if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation&#x27;s users beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Additional Terms.
“Additional permissions” are terms that supplement the terms of this License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent that they are valid under applicable law. If additional permissions apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by this License without regard to the additional permissions.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it. (Additional permissions may be written to require their own removal in certain cases when you modify the work.) You may place additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work, for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#65737e;&quot;&gt;&#x2F;&#x2F; This is the main function

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;println!&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; is a macro that prints text to the console.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A binary can be generated using the Rust compiler: &lt;code&gt;rustc&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;rustc&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; will produce a &lt;code&gt;hello&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; binary that can be executed.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

        <content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;requirements&quot;&gt;Requirements&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before using the theme, you need to install the &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.getzola.org&#x2F;documentation&#x2F;getting-started&#x2F;installation&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Zola&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; ≥ 0.15.0.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;run-the-theme-directly&quot;&gt;Run the Theme Directly&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;bash&quot; style=&quot;background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;&quot; class=&quot;language-bash &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#bf616a;&quot;&gt;git&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; clone https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;aaranxu&#x2F;adidoks.git
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#96b5b4;&quot;&gt;cd&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; adidoks
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#bf616a;&quot;&gt;zola&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; serve
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visit &lt;code&gt;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;127.0.0.1:1111&#x2F;&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; in the browser.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;installation&quot;&gt;Installation&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just earlier we showed you how to run the theme directly. Now we start to
install the theme in an existing site step by step.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;step-1-create-a-new-zola-site&quot;&gt;Step 1: Create a new zola site&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;bash&quot; style=&quot;background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;&quot; class=&quot;language-bash &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#bf616a;&quot;&gt;zola&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; init mysite
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;step-2-install-adidoks&quot;&gt;Step 2: Install AdiDoks&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Download this theme to your themes directory:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;bash&quot; style=&quot;background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;&quot; class=&quot;language-bash &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#96b5b4;&quot;&gt;cd&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; mysite&#x2F;themes
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#bf616a;&quot;&gt;git&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; clone https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;aaranxu&#x2F;adidoks.git
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or install as a submodule:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;bash&quot; style=&quot;background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;&quot; class=&quot;language-bash &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#96b5b4;&quot;&gt;cd&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; mysite
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#bf616a;&quot;&gt;git&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; init  &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#65737e;&quot;&gt;# if your project is a git repository already, ignore this command
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#bf616a;&quot;&gt;git&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; submodule add https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;aaranxu&#x2F;adidoks.git themes&#x2F;adidoks
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;step-3-configuration&quot;&gt;Step 3: Configuration&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enable the theme in your &lt;code&gt;config.toml&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; in the site derectory:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;toml&quot; style=&quot;background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;&quot; class=&quot;language-toml &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-toml&quot; data-lang=&quot;toml&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#bf616a;&quot;&gt;theme &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;= &amp;quot;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#a3be8c;&quot;&gt;adidoks&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;quot;
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or copy the &lt;code&gt;config.toml.example&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; from the theme directory to your project&#x27;s
root directory:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;bash&quot; style=&quot;background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;&quot; class=&quot;language-bash &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#bf616a;&quot;&gt;cp&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; themes&#x2F;adidoks&#x2F;config.toml.example config.toml
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;step-4-add-new-content&quot;&gt;Step 4: Add new content&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can copy the content from the theme directory to your project:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;bash&quot; style=&quot;background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;&quot; class=&quot;language-bash &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#bf616a;&quot;&gt;cp -r&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; themes&#x2F;adidoks&#x2F;content .
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can modify or add new posts in the &lt;code&gt;content&#x2F;blog&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;content&#x2F;docs&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; or other
content directories as needed.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;step-5-run-the-project&quot;&gt;Step 5: Run the project&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just run &lt;code&gt;zola serve&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; in the root path of the project:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;bash&quot; style=&quot;background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;&quot; class=&quot;language-bash &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#bf616a;&quot;&gt;zola&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; serve
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AdiDoks will start the Zola development web server accessible by default at 
&lt;code&gt;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;127.0.0.1:1111&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;. Saved changes will live reload in the browser.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

headings. &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; is the highest section level while &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;h6&amp;gt;&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; is the lowest.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

        <link rel="alternate" href="https://mere.dev/blog/math-typesetting/" type="text/html"/>
        <id>https://mere.dev/blog/math-typesetting/</id>
        
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In this example we will be using &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;katex.org&#x2F;&quot;&gt;KaTeX&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a macro under &lt;code&gt;&#x2F;template&#x2F;macros&#x2F;math.html&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; with a macro named &lt;code&gt;math&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Within this macro reference the &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;katex.org&#x2F;docs&#x2F;autorender.html&quot;&gt;Auto-render Extension&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; or host these scripts locally.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Import the macro in your templates like so:&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;bash&quot; style=&quot;background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;&quot; class=&quot;language-bash &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#bf616a;&quot;&gt;{&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;% import &amp;#39;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#a3be8c;&quot;&gt;macros&#x2F;math.html&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;#39; as macros %}
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#bf616a;&quot;&gt;{&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;% if page.extra.math or section.extra.math or config.extra.math %}
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#bf616a;&quot;&gt;{{&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; macros::math() }}
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#bf616a;&quot;&gt;{&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;% endif %}
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To enable KaTex globally set the parameter &lt;code&gt;extra.math&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;true&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; in a project&#x27;s configuration&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To enable KaTex on a per page basis include the parameter &lt;code&gt;extra.math = true&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; in content files&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The MathJax library is the other optional choice, and you can set the parameter &lt;code&gt;extra.library&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;mathjax&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; in a project&#x27;s configuration&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use the online reference of &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;katex.org&#x2F;docs&#x2F;supported.html&quot;&gt;Supported TeX Functions&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;examples&quot;&gt;Examples&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Inline math: \(\varphi = \dfrac{1+\sqrt5}{2}= 1.6180339887…\) 
&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Block math:
$$
\varphi = 1+\frac{1} {1+\frac{1} {1+\frac{1} {1+\cdots} } } 
$$&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
