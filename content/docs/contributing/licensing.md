## Preamble


By the grace of God, Amen. His kingdom come, His will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.

We mere software engineers, automation architects and digital developers, find ourselves heirs to many great blessings of liberty and prosperity from those faithful generations before us, yet we seek to ensure the blessings of our Maker for our posterity, as loyal subjects of our Lord and King Jesus Christ.


we have come into such a time that it seems necessary to provide hedges and boundaries, that the work of our hands may not be used blaspheme, and that all men shall recognize and proclaim the Lordship of Jesus Christ over all of life. 


As has been the example and tradition of those many generations before us; in the examples of
- Magna Carta 1215.
Columbus Letter Announcing His Discovery 1493.
- The Mayflower Compact 1620.
- Pennsylvania Charter of Privileges 1701.
#Give Me Liberty Or Give Me Death Patrick Henry, 1775.
- The Declaration of Independence 1776.
- Constitution of the United States ratified 1788.

we establish this written covenant for all jurisdictions and all times, and by way example implementation, also memorialize an accompanying license to use, as is our current custom for intellectual properties.
