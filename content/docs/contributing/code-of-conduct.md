## Our Standards

Our standards must be grounded in the pursuit of Truth. We recognize that Truth is not always obvious at first, and must often be discovered through rigorious debate. Therefore we expect a common understanding and tolerance for freedom on speech, including seemingly offensive speech. This does not mean unlimited restrictions however, and the following are not considered protected speech

* Any speech meant to incite violence
* Any form of blasphemy
* Any oppression of Religion

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* Any activity meant to diminish human flourishing
* Any activity meant to prevent the free expression of religion
* Any activity meant to destroy our mission and community
* Any activity which may cause undue harm to children, or any other person not capable of autonomy

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of
acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and corrective action in
response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation
decisions when appropriate.


## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at
<contact@mere.dev>.

Anyone accused has the right to face their accuser.
Anyone has the right to resolve their dispute through arbitration with mutually elected mediators.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders may consult and quote The Bible for guidelines in determining
the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct.

Community leaders may choose to adopt mutual arbitration, providing that all 
arbtitrators respect the use of the Bible and God's law
