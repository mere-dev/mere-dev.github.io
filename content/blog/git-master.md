## The offense of the Master


There has been some greate kerfuffle as of late over the use of the word "master" in git branches, purporting that all good developers should instead rename all such branches to "main"

I for one, consider this to not only be the height of stupidity, but also an evil we should seek to reverse. But to explain that I need to lay some groundwork.

#### Slavery

```
Gal 1:10 For am I now seeking the approval of man, or of God? Or am I trying to please man? If I were still trying to please man, I would not be a bond-servant of Christ.
