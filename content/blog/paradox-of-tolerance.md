title = "The Paradox of Tolerance"
+++


We should tolerate everything except intolerance
we should have the freedom to do anything except prevent freedom
We should have the freedom of any speech, except the speech


The problem with all of these statements of course is the unsaid assumptions that underly their meaning. What we accept as our axiom drastically effect the interpretation of these, even to the point of completely reversing their meanings.

For instance with tolerance, why is tolerance a virtue to be pursued at all? Why not just be equally intolerant of all things? It may seem a much simpler philosophy and therefore, by the rule of Occam's razor, should we not give more weight to it's argument?
